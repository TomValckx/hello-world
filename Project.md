# The project

The goal of our project is to find out which countries or teams are the most popular in the Netherlands during the Football World Cup in Russia, we analyze this by looking at 4 Dutch newswebsites and we count both the number of times each country is named and the number of articles that the country appears in. 

# The data

We used wget with recursion to download the websites from NOS, NU, AD and de Telegraaf.

**__Same number of files, new wget?__**

# The results
We find the following results for the different newspapers

**AD**
